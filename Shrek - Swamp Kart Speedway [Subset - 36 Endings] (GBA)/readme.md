## Overview
This is a subset of Shrek: Swamp Kart Speedway for completing the game using all characters on all difficulties for a total of 36 playthroughs. The game's story is designed such that every character on each difficulty has its own progression. So, if a player wishes to switch character or difficulty in the middle of a playthrough, they would have to restart from the very first race.
