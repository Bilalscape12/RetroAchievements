## Overview
Attention! Inhabitants of Earth,

We, the Vortaak, have taken control of your planet's monsters and will use them to rule over your world. Select your champion from a pool of 11 monsters and take the offensive by fighting your way to our Mothership. But be warned, this Adventure will require you face 8 opponents including our ultimate monster. Or take the defensive and try your best to Survive against an endless wave of monsters. How many monsters will you defeat before you crumble beneath our might?

You may now return to... whatever it is you were doing... idiots.
